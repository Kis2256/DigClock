	Mode Switching and Clock Settings via Terminal and UART Communication

All device control is carried out through the terminal using UART communication.
To switch between the three operating modes of the device, the following commands are used:
“Time” – switches the clock to the standard time display mode.
To exit the time display mode, press any key on the computer keyboard. The clock menu will then appear on the LCD screen and in the terminal.
“Config” – after entering this command, the time setting mode is activated.
Time is entered step by step using the keyboard: first hours, then minutes, and then seconds.
If any entered value does not correspond to valid hour, minute, or second values, an error is displayed: “Invalid input!”
“Stopwatch” – enters the stopwatch mode, where a separate submenu appears for its operation:
“Start” – starts the stopwatch
“Stop” – stops the stopwatch
“Reset” – resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00:00
“Exit” – exits the stopwatch mode and returns to the main menu.

Every hour, a green LED will blink to indicate the number of hours that have passed.
